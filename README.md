# Pathfinding & Maze Generation Visualizer

A **React**-based graphical application for visualizing pathfinding algorithms and maze generation techniques. This open-source project serves as a foundation for developers and educators to explore, experiment with, and extend various algorithms in an interactive environment.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Pathfinding Algorithms**

  1. Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm
  2. A\* Search
  3. Greedy Best-First Search
  4. Bidirectional Greedy Search
  5. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  6. Depth-First Search (DFS)
  7. Random Walk

* **Maze Generation Techniques**

  1. Random Maze
  2. Recursive Division
  3. Vertical Division
  4. Horizontal Division

## üöÄ Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with **Create React App**. To run locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ajad-cpu/AlgoPath.git
   cd AlgoPath
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## üß© Usage

* **Select** a pathfinding algorithm and optional maze generation technique.
* **Customize** grid size by adding walls or weights.
* **Run** the visualization to observe the algorithm step-by-step.
* **Reset** at any time to experiment with new configurations.
